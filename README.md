# 🐟 Predicting Fish Populations: A Data-Driven Approach to Sustainable Harvesting
## Contributers: Therese Dao & Kristina Nguyen

📖 Overview

This project analyzes factors influencing fish populations along the California coastline using geospatial analysis and machine learning. By examining total fish catch data from fisheries, we explore the impact of environmental (SST, precipitation) and socioeconomic (fishing policies, MPAs) variables on fish populations.

🔍 Key Insights

Geospatial Analysis: Hot spot analysis revealed sparse patterns, suggesting a weak correlation between fish catches and environmental variables.
Machine Learning Models: Prediction accuracy was limited by data inconsistencies, multicollinearity, and sparsity, requiring further refinement.
Sustainability & Fisheries Management: Adaptive fishing strategies, data-driven decision-making, and real-time monitoring are crucial for balancing profitability and sustainability.

📜 Conclusion

This study highlights the complex interactions between climate, human activity, and marine ecosystems. While challenges remain, the findings offer a foundation for future research and sustainable fisheries management.
